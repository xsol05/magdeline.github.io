Hello world!

I graduated from the University of Otago last December where I studied Computer Science and Entrepreneurship, and now I'm working as a Software Engineer at a fintech / regtech scaleup (a startup in growth phase).

It's been 6 months and I've learnt so much, so I figured it was about time I started a blog to document all my learnings!

Except rather than a blog, I'd like to think of this as my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) where I [#learninpublic](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) üìù

I plan to populate my garden with plants on:

- The stack I'm using: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, styled-components, GraphQL
- Misc stuff eg how to use DevTools, the DOM, writing tests, my fav tech people
- Projects I build
- My journey as a Software Engineer

Note that there is no set planting schedule, and the plants may be re-tended to.

I hope you enjoy visiting my garden üå∑

And I look forward to being invited to yours one day üòõ
