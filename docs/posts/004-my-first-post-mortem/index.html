They document what happened, learnings, and how to avoid it in the future. Thereâ€™s no naming and shaming the perpetrator of the incident.\nPostmortems are not about figuring out who to blame for an incident that happened. They are about figuring out, through data and analysis, what happened, why it happened, and how it can be stopped from happening again. - Arni Birgisson My first incident As luck would have it, I had my first incident last week ðŸ˜…\nLet me explain: I was the feature lead for a feature. The feature involved replacing some old components with new ones. One of the components replaced also had a validation check added to it. This check was run through Product, and the whole feature underwent extensive QA testing in various environments. Everything was going smoothly so when I received the green light, I shipped the feature aka I released it into our production code base, meaning our users would be able to access the feature.\nI posted an announcement in the release channel then gave myself a pat on the back. Woohoo! ðŸ¥³ This feature took several sprints and I was so glad it was finally shipped.\nAbout half an hour later, my colleague alerts me of a tech support ticket created regarding my feature. Not too long after, I get pulled into another Slack thread regarding the same issue reported about the feature. Before I know it, an incident management process is kickstarted and my feature gets reverted from production ðŸ¤¡\nA wave of emotions overcome me. Embarrassment, humiliation, sadness, disappointment, perplexion, indignation.\nI knew that it wasnâ€™t my fault, or anyoneâ€™s fault for that matter, and no one was blaming me either. But, since I made the change and shipped the feature, I couldnâ€™t help but feel a sense of responsibility. And you know, your first one just hits differently ok? ðŸ¥²\nSo first things first. Iâ€™m human and itâ€™s natural to feel all these emotions, so I allowed myself to acknowledge them instead of just brushing them away.\nThen I reflected on the whole process and wrote some notes in preparation for our postmortem meeting. I documented what happened, why it happened, the incident timeline, mitigations, and various discussion points.\nThe meeting went smoothly and we had some great discussions, even discovering another unrelated issue through this incident.\nAll was well.\nWhat I learnt This incident sparked a bunch of thoughts:\n1. What constitutes a discussion As I was working on the feature, I came across a bug in the same area that was present in production. I posted a message in the feature channel about the bug and whether a certain field was required. Product replied that it was. Because of that, I added the validation check. This validation check ended up being the cause of the incident.\nIn retrospect, that was hardly a discussion ðŸ˜…\nIt was simply a question and answer on Slack.\nHad I messaged more and clarified if it would be alright to add the validation check, perhaps we might have done a bit more thinking about the user flow of the form. And just maybe, this issue could have been picked up on.\n2. User testing is so important Everything seemed to be going fine with my feature. It passed all the code reviews, it passed all the QA testing.\nSo why did this validation check issue not get picked up on?\nItâ€™s because we did not test it with the end users themselves.\nSure, we as engineers and testers can write and test our feature, but how we use it might be very different to how our end users use it.\nHereâ€™s a meme of how differently engineers and users think ðŸ¤£\nSide note: Usually before we release a feature, we will have a Bug Bash, an event where various people, both from the Product and Engineering Team and the wider business, will test out the feature. Itâ€™s where these sorts of issues get picked up on. But because of the small scale and low risk of this feature, we didnâ€™t have one ðŸ¥²\n3. Writing tests for your code is key Tests are a great way to spot an issue before it occurring.\nYou bet that after we fixed the issue, we wrote tests for various scenarios to prevent this issue from happening again ðŸ¤¡\n4. After releasing a feature, monitor the bugs channel It goes without saying, but one should always monitor the bugs channel after a feature is released.\nI never did this in the past because of how low risk my releases were, but this incident taught me a lesson.\nAlways monitor the bugs channel after a release so that you can be on standby to put out any fires! ðŸ”¥\n5. How to manage incidents in the future Since this was my first time getting involved in an incident, I was pretty clueless about the incident management process, so shout out to my colleagues for carrying me through. To put it bluntly, I felt like I was a bystander observing the firefighters put out a fire I had caused lmao ðŸ¤£\nOn the bright side, this was a fantastic opportunity for me to get acquainted with the process!\nAfterthoughts Thankfully, this incident was fairly small, low risk, and was resolved relatively quickly. There was no impact on the customers either.\nEveryone congratulated me for my first incident / postmortem because itâ€™s something we all experience at some point and graduate from ðŸ˜…\nMy manager also told me that experiencing your first incident is a sign that youâ€™re growing fast and should be celebrated.\nMy VP of Engineering even said heâ€™s over the moon about us having more incidents as there is no cheaper time than right now in a fast-growing business to have incidents and practise handling them so we can build robust and resilient processes.\nI really appreciate the blameless culture we have here as it makes making and learning from mistakes a lot easier.\n","wordCount":"1025","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://magdelinehuang.com/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2022-08-19T14:09:59+12:00","dateModified":"2022-08-19T14:09:59+12:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Magdeline Huang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://magdelinehuang.com/posts/004-my-first-post-mortem/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Magdeline Huang","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://magdelinehuang.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://magdelinehuang.com/ accesskey=h title="Magdeline Huang (Alt + H)">Magdeline Huang</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://magdelinehuang.com/archive/ title=archive><span>archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://magdelinehuang.com/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://magdelinehuang.com/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://magdelinehuang.com/changelog/ title=changelog><span>changelog</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://magdelinehuang.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;Â»&nbsp;<a href=https://magdelinehuang.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>ðŸ’€ My First Postmortem</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-08-19 14:09:59 +1200 NZST'>August 19, 2022</span>&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;1025 words&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;Magdeline Huang</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#what-is-a-postmortem>What is a postmortem</a></li><li><a href=#my-first-incident>My first incident</a></li><li><a href=#what-i-learnt>What I learnt</a><ul><li><a href=#1-what-constitutes-a-discussion>1.
